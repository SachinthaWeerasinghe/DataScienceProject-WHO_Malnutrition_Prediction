Malnutrition Risk Prediction using Neural Networks
This notebook demonstrates the process of building and training a simple feedforward neural network for binary classification, 
aiming to predict whether a child is at risk of malnutrition based on a given dataset.

Key Steps:
Data Preparation:

Loaded a dataset with 55,436 samples and 16 features.
The target variable is malnutrition_risk (yes/no).
The dataset was split into training and test sets (80/20).
Features were standardized using StandardScaler.


Model Design:

A sequential neural network with:
Input layer (16 features).
Two hidden layers with ReLU activation.
Output layer using sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Model compiled with Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the metric.
Training and Evaluation:

Trained over 20 epochs with batch size 32 and validation split of 20%.
Evaluated the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance on the test set.
Provided classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Visualized training and validation accuracy and loss.
This model offers a foundation for predicting malnutrition risk and can be further optimized or expanded with additional tuning or feature engineering.
